Properties language's syntax highlighting. 
Inspired from: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html and https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/userguide/howto_properties.html.

Syntax highlighting is supported only for key-value-comment instructions at the moment.

It lacks:
 - escape characters
 - multiple line spanning values
